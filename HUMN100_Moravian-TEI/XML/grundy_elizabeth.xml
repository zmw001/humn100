                  Grundy</persName>, late Alvd, who <name type="event">departed this life</name>
                  at <placeName>Nayldon</placeName> in <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName>, <date>May
                     the 9th 1799</date>. She has dictated the following account of her life to her
                  son, our <persName>Br. James Grundy</persName>: <name type="event">I was
                     born</name>
                  <date>February 6. 1717</date>. near <placeName>Chowbent</placeName> in the parish
                  of Leigh in <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, and brought up in the
                  <orgName>Presbyterian</orgName> persuasion. My parents were very pious, and
                  educated their children with great strictness. I was the youngest of their
                  daughters. Whenever I did any thing amiss, my mother used to preach the Law to me,
                  which made me look upon <roleName>God</roleName> as an <name type="emotion"
                     >angry</name> Being. In my 8th year that I had the following dream: I dreamed
                  it was the <name type="event">day of judgment</name>, and I saw an innumerable
                  multitude around me. I wished to see our <roleName>Savior</roleName> but was <name
                     type="emotion">afraid</name> of being seen by him; however, as I thought, I
                  moved forward, and thrust myself between two persons to have a right of him. This
                  I had no sooner done than he turned to me, as he was sitting at a table, and <name
                     type="emotion">smiled</name>. Hereby I was to much <name type="emotion"
                        >encouraged</name>, that I went strait up to him, and now I saw two books lying
                  before </p>
            </div>

               <p> him. One of them he opened, which I took to be the book of life, as it appeared
                  written with blood. Upon this I awoke, but the dream left an impression upon my
                  mind, that our <roleName>Savior</roleName> was very <name type="emotion"
                     >loving</name> however, I left it again by having the law preached to me. Thus
                  I spent my years of childhood like most others. I wanted to be good, but could
                  not. Still I depended much on being born of religious parents, as being the seed
                  of the righteous, upon which the <orgName>Presbyterians</orgName> of that day laid
                  great stress. <name type="event">My father dying in my 12th year</name>, my mother
                  was left to care for our education, and to provide for our maintenance. The latter
                  she did by keeping a school, and the former she performed in the strictest manner,
                  and she sometimes corrected us very sharply, as she took
                  <persName>Solomon</persName>’s words for her rank: "He that shareth the rod,
                  hateth his son '_' Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he
                  will not depart from it." Before my fathers death <name type="health">I had a
                     fever</name>, which, with occasional intermissions, lasted 18 weeks, but I
                  always thought I should recover. When I was 14 years old <name type="event">I went
                     to nurse a child</name> of a relation; and going on to see my mother our
                  <roleName>Savior</roleName> drew me in to my heart on the road: </p>
            </div>

            <div type="page" n="3">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300023-03">3</head>
               <p> and in my prayer I addressed him as the <roleName>God</roleName> of
                  <persName>Abraham</persName>, <persName>Isaac</persName> and
                  <persName>Jacob</persName>. It came into my mind to <name type="event">make a
                     covenant with him</name>, and then being some stones in the place, I took them
                  for a witness of it. But I soon <name type="event">broke this covenant</name>, for
                  getting into company I lived like others, yet my conscience always condemned me.
                  Thus I formed good resolutions and as often brake them again; still the
                  <roleName>Lord</roleName> pursued me with infinite patience. In my 22nd year
                  <name type="event">I commenced school</name> keeping under the inspection of
                  the <persName>Revd. Mr. Valentine</persName>, a <orgName>Presbyterian</orgName>
                  Minister. He being an Arian, tho not of the worst soul, I imbibed some of his
                  principles. I argued with my mother about Predestination, and their great show of
                  religion; and told her, among the rest, that thou who held that doctrine were
                  hypocrites. This made her examine herself, as she told me of on her deathbed,
                  thanking me for it and declaring that she had found my observation true with
                  regard to herself. During her last illness she felt great condemnation, all her
                  sins appearing to her view, which made her turn to our <roleName>Savior</roleName>
                  and cry out: "Dear <roleName>Savior</roleName>, where is thy precious blood, that
                  blood which thou did/ </p>
            </div>

            <div type="page" n="4">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300023-04">4</head>
               <p> shed to cleanse me from my sins?" Scarce had she uttered this ejaculation, when
                  our <roleName>Savior</roleName> appeared to the eye of her faith, in his bleeding
                  attitude, which the soldier opened his side with the spear, and she felt as it
                  were his blood trickling upon her heart. Now she was enabled to rejoin in
                     <roleName>God</roleName> our <roleName>Savior</roleName>. Shortly before <name type="event">her
                  end</name> she said: "Come, Lord <roleName>Jesus</roleName>, come quickly," and then fell
                  asleep in <roleName>Jesus</roleName> with a lovely smile upon her countenance. Her
                  <name type='emotion'>happily</name> departure made so deep an impression upon me that I could never forget it,
                  at the same time begetting a strong desire within me, to profess real religion;
                  but to this the vanities of the world proved a great hindrance. Nevertheless, my
                  mind was strongly convicted of my folly; one night in particular, which at a
                  dance, I was so terrified, that I was obliged to withdraw, being struck with the
                  reflection, what would become of me, if I should be cut off in that state. Another
                  time I was so alarmed at my situation that I went to the above mentioned minister
                  after midnight and called him up; but he told me that I had nothing to fear, as I
                  had always been a good woman, and that <roleName>God</roleName> was merciful and
                  would not mark iniquity so strictly. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div type="page" n="5">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300023-05">5</head>
               <p> Thus I was rightly served for having applied to him instead of our
                     <roleName>Savior</roleName>. I expected he would have put me in the way of
                  doing something whereby to merit heaven; but instead of this, he addressed me to
                  put it off by going into cheerful company, lest I should grow <name type='emotion'>melancholy</name>. I
                  foolishly took his advice, endeavoring to shake off conviction as much as
                  possible. In this way I proceeded till I was married, and even after that, for a
                  while, followed the fashions of the world. But, my husband, being a religious
                  member of the <orgName>church of England</orgName>, protested against that mode of living. His
                  Minister being an unawakened man and performing divine service only in the
                  morning, we went in the afternoon to a Baptist chapel. Under a sermon in that
                  place on the words: "Almost thou persuadest me to be a
                     <orgName>Christian</orgName>," we were both so affected that we wept, which the
                  Minister showed, how far a person may go, and yet be only almost a <orgName>christian</orgName>. We
                  continued to hear him till the <name type="event">birth of my first child</name>, when he wanted to persuade
                  us not to <name type="event">have it baptized</name>, to which my husband would by no means agree. My
                  husband read frequently in the New Testament and when he loved the book, used to
                  say : "I </p>
            </div>

               <p> thank God for Paul's Epistles; best this of my taste at that to live, for I would
                  rather read of Goliath, Lampoon, Joseph, he's brethren on of battles; however he
                  continued reading Paul's Epistles, without minding one. My husband being an
                  officer is the exercise his duty was frequently too hard for, so that he was often
                  ailing. In January 1749. he ever taken seriously ill, and sent, that he should
                  like to deposit, adding, thou am happy, who can soon leave the world in peace. I
                  complained that he had lost his regard for me, but he assured me, that his love
                  for me was not decreased; but he saw nothing in this world worth existing to stay
                  in it for. I then asked him, 'whether he was first to leave?' He replied, "All my
                  fitness is what Jesus Christ did for we on the cross." This I did not then
                  understand. In that state of heart he departed, which was accompanied with such a
                  happy feeling, as filled me with astonishment. His death took place Feb. 22, 1748.
                  In the 29th year of his age. After his Departure, their words: "I will be a
                  husband to the widow, and a father to the fatherly", were interpreted upon my
                  mind; you </p>

               <p> I was full of disbelief and not say, "Thy will be done." Then I was left with out
                  house or home, having one child, called William, and far advanced in pregnancy
                  with another. I soon set off for my native plan, which was 200 miles different,
                  and travelled on foot nine days, in frost and snow. On the arrival at the home of
                  one of my sisters, my husband's father sent for me and took me into his family.
                  Here I was in about three weeks brought to bed of my son, James, with whom I now
                  live, and who is a member of the brother church and one of their preachers. After
                  the birth of my son, confidently that he had now no father to care for him, it was
                  as tho' our savior stood at my bed side and comforted me. I laid my hand on the
                  childs' head and devoted him to the Loved and his service and to the entirety his.
                  This ever accompanied with the deepest sensation I had ever had of the presence of
                  Jesus, and yet it was as if he said to me, "Thou does not know me yet." Indeed I
                  did not know him, even by the name of Jesus, but only as the God of Abraham, Isaac
                  and Jacob; and when I did again and again, I found no comfort; but </p>

               <p> at last, it was impressed on end to call when Jesus, which I did, saying, "Lend
                  Jesus have mercy upon me!" No sooner had I called upon him by that name, them my
                  condemnation was all taken away, and I rejoiced wondering at there at the same
                  time, that I had read my Bible so often, and had never called upon
                        <persName><roleName>Jesus</roleName></persName> before. Now then words came
                  into my mind, "He shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his people from their
                  sins, and I rejoiced in God my Savior. This impression was so deeply fixed in my
                  heart, that when relieving to rest, I always looked to him in spirit on hanging
                  of, on the cross. For sometime after, I had been concerned for my salvation, and
                  now I felt delirious to be connected with a people of God. In this view I went to
                  bear the Methodists, looking upon the, as a people of God. I read Mr. Whitfield's
                  Sermon and saved several of Mr. Wesley's preachers. I joined the Methodists, and
                  with great Zeal frequented their meetings tho I had sometimes to walk four miles
                  in the dark. But by and bye, observing how they differed among themselves about
                  points of doctrine, I left them, thinking they were not a people of God. </p>

               <p> because they were not of one heart and mind. About this time I heard of the
                  Brethren, getting my first impressions of them by means of their hymn book of
                  which I was very fond, especially of that hymn: "O tell me no more of this world's
                  veins story; The time for such trifles with me now is o'er. I wished much to know,
                  where to find thou people, who had published their hymns. At lengths I learned
                  that they had a chapel in Dierkenfield, and that they were expected soon to preach
                  at a home in Thackerley, a with different from when I live. I waited with the
                  greatest pleasure and satisfaction and spent the whole day in his company. Indeed
                  I received him in another Apostle Paul. Immediately thought, "this people shall be
                  my people, their God my God, with them. I will live and die and be buried"; and of
                  this resolution I never repented. This was fulfilled what my dear late mother said
                  to me, shortly before her departure for calling me alone to her bedside she said:
                  "I have waited with our savior, and was </p>

               <p> assured that thou shall be his and belong to the people of God, but what people
                  and where and when I cannot tell; but it will not be yet; After this Mr.
                  Valentine, the abovementioned Arian Minister, told me, I had changed for the women
                  by joining the Brother. I sent him the nine discourses on Christ's Divinity, by
                  Count Zinzendorf; but they did not please him. Soon after he fell sick; I felt
                  great concern for him and went often to converse with him. whenever I mentioned
                  anything about the discourses I sent him, he was out of patience and desired me to
                  visit him no more; nevertheless, I told him, that I was concerned for him and
                  should call again to see him. However stayed away for sometime, but hearing that
                  he grew very weak, I resolved to visit him again, as I felt very anxious about his
                  happiness. Coming to his home I was informed by his daughter, that he endured her
                  to suffer more to come to him, not even his own children. I therefore sent my love
                  to him, which was ongoing after his health. This being delivered, he desired his
                  daughter to send me to him, as he wished to see me. When I came to his bed side,
                  he put out his hands to me, and appeared like an affectionate, loving child, and
                  said "We have had many arguments, but </p>

               <p> now I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior." I replied. " He is a Savior to them
                  that believe." To this he replied: "I do believe, and I have no merit of my own;
                  but trust alone in my Savior's death and merits. There is something to go through
                  in death, but the prophet beyond it is bright; but I cannot say much, I was very
                  weak. "We then took a tender leave of each other, and soon after he departed in
                  peace. My oldest son, William, died the same year, after a long illness. Shortly
                  before his departure, being very sensible of his approaching dissolution, he
                  called on to his bed, expected his desire to go to Jesus, bade each other
                  farewell, and looked his eyes and fell happily asleep in the Lord, in the 7th year
                  of his age. In 1755 a congregation of the Brother was settled at Dierkenfield, at
                  which solemnity I was profound and my heart was offered like that of Lydia. From
                  that time connection with the church of the Brethren became very weighty to me and
                  has remained so ever since, one which account I was the more greived at not being
                  received a member of them; this favour was, however, granted me the year
                  following. At Thackeray, I opened a little shop for my man and had a good prophet
                  of doing well; but feeling my heart in danger of being drawn </p>

                  losing by any means that <name type="emotion">happiness</name>, which was then and
                  has been ever since of the last importance to me, I gave my shopkeeping in the
                  midst of prosperity, and these words of our <roleName>savior</roleName> followed
                  me continually, "What shall it profit a man, tho' he gains the whole <name
                     type="object">world</name> and loves his own <name type="object">soul</name>."
                  And I think it would because for many, even members of the <orgName>Brethren
                     church</orgName>, of this was barely considered. I can say with truth, that
                  from that day to this, our <roleName>savior</roleName>, and fellowship with his
                  people have been more important to me than anything else in the world. </p>
               <p> In <date>August 1756</date>. <name type="event">I moved</name> to
                  <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>, as a member of that congregation. Here I
                  found it very difficult to come through. I had not only to go twenty miles for the
                  work, by which I earned a livelihood, but the necessities of life, particularly
                  <name type="object">bread</name> ran to double the price, they had been sold
                  for a fifth before. Yet I never repented of having moved hither, but was <name
                     type="emotion">content</name> and <name type="emotion">happy</name> with a
                  small portion of very mean, fare; and my son, who was now nine years old, was the
                  same. Our <roleName>savior</roleName> abundantly blessed us internally, and we
                  spent our time, while at work, with singing of Him and his sufferings, being
                  enabled to take our refuge to him in all our circumstances. </p>

               </head>
               <p> When things were at the worst we would sing: "As small <name type="object"
                  >birds</name> are a hole to cheer In hollow <name type="object">trees</name>
                  for cover, When whirlwinds blow when <name type="object">hail</name> and <name
                     type="object">snow</name> O'er man and beast do hover: So I to then,
                  <roleName>Lord Christ</roleName>, do flee, Within thy wounds retired; When sin
                  and death did stop my breath, Here I again reposed." This time was indeed a
                  blessed period. In <date>January 1758</date>. I had the favour to <name
                     type="event">partake of the H.C.</name> for the first time in the
                  <orgName>Brethren church</orgName>. I felt so <name type="emotion"
                     >unworthy</name> of it, that I hardly durst venture; "<name type="emotion"
                        >Heav'nly joy</name> and holy trembling I felt in me past dissembling." This
                  divine repast proved a great blessing to me. Hitherto I had been in a certain
                  rapturous way, which in some measure was there more looked for, them a sinners'
                  believing reliance on the all sufficient merit and atonement of
                  <roleName>Christ</roleName>. I had made a fine covenant with our
                  <roleName>savior</roleName> to be his in all circumstances, both adverse and
                  prosperous, not questioning but I could stand any trial, for I <name
                     type="emotion">fear</name>, that he had possession of my <name type="object"
                        >heart</name>, and I had an <name type="emotion">assurance</name> that he would
                  safely lead me. Not withstand</p>

               <p> ding this I had soon after a severe trial, which was augmented by my want of self
                  knowledge. Falling <name type="health">sick</name> and feeling myself very <name
                     type="emotion">poor</name>, and full of <name type="emotion">unbelief</name>, I
                  began to question the love of our <roleName>Savior</roleName>, thinking, if the
                  <roleName>Lord</roleName> be with me, why am I thus? Hitherto I had imagined
                  that believers had a fund of support within themselves, so that I thought, it was
                  inconsistent with a child of <roleName>God</roleName> to have any <name
                     type="object">doubts</name> and <name type="object">fears.</name> Thus I was so
                  confounded as to be almost driven to despair, and because like a shipwrecked
                  mariner, thrown at once from the pleasing prosperity the promised land upon a
                  desolate rock, where nothing appeared but horror &amp; devastation. The <name
                     type="emotion">gloom</name>, which had thus overspread me, continued a good
                  while, and tho' I had frequent visits from our <roleName>Savior</roleName>, still
                  I could not regain my <name type="emotion">cheerfulness</name>, for I had not yet
                  learned to cleave daily by faith as a needy sinner to <roleName>Jesus</roleName>.
                  Indeed this point was not then so well moderated by some of us, as it has been
                  since; After it was expected that a child of <roleName>God</roleName> should be
                  <name type="emotion">cheerful</name> and <name type="emotion">happy</name>
                  without any interruption, and this idea afforded me sufficient cause for self
                  condemnation. But since then I have learned to know more of the privilege, <name
                     type="emotion"/> by a believer, of turning with all his selfishness, to our
                  <roleName>Savior</roleName> and finding </p>

               <p> in him a present help in time of need, which is an inexhaustible fund, where we
                  may take grace for grace, and not look for it in any of our own attainments. Some
                  time after I was appointed to begin a <name type="object">school</name> for girls
                  in <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>, which gave me great <name type="emotion"
                     >confidence</name> in our <roleName>Savior</roleName>, considering it as an
                  answer to my prayer; for I was at times so full of unbelief, that I thought myself
                  beneath his notice. <name type="event">I opened this school</name> with eleven
                  girls, children of some of the <orgName>Brethren church</orgName>, and continued
                  it fifteen years. This was a <name type="emotion">happy</name> period both for me
                  and the children, several of the latter afterwards became members of the
                  <orgName>Congregation</orgName> and likewise some of their parents. At length,
                  not being able to procure a proper place for my <name type="object">school</name>,
                  and having to give up the hours I had hitherto occupied, I was, to my great <name

                  disagreeable occurrences, it appeared as if the time for my <name type="event"
                     >continuing the school was over</name>. About this time my son, whom from his
                  birth I had entirely devoted to our <roleName>Savior</roleName>, <name

                  distance] from <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>, who behaved very well to me, I
                  began to grow tired of having so far to go to the meeting. I therefore, sought
                  leave to live in <placeName>Fulneck</placeName>, which I obtained. I went thither
                  in <date>1778</date>, and <name type="event">lodged as a visitor in the widow's

               <p> trials, was the imperfection that my <roleName>Savior</roleName> had died for me,
                  and this, I trust will remain so unto the end. I say indeed from my inmost <name
                     type="object">soul</name>: "His death and passion ever, Till <name
                        type="object">soul</name> and <name type="object">body</name> sever, Shall in
                  my <name type="object">heart</name> engraved remain." This has been indelibly
                  impressed upon my <name type="object">mind</name>, ever since he first manifested
                  himself to my soul as my <roleName>Redeemer</roleName>. In <date>May 1780</date>.
                  my son received a call to <name type="event">begin a school and care</name> for
                  the <orgName>Brethren Society</orgName> in <placeName>Bayldon</placeName>. In
                  consequence of this <name type="event">he married.</name> My daughter in less
                  growing consumption after her first delivery, <name type="event">moved</name> for
                  her health to her parents in <placeName>Huddersfield</placeName>, where <name
                     type="event">she departed this life</name>, and <name>the child soon followed
                        her</name> into eternity. I therefore <name type="event">went to live with my
                           son</name> in <date>October 1787</date>. and <name type="event">began a school
                              for girls</name>; and in this situation I have remained till now, when I live
                  in daily expectation to be dismissed from all labour and <name type="emotion"
                     >sorrow</name>, eternally to rest and rejoice in the presence of my
                  <roleName>God</roleName> &amp; <roleName>Savior</roleName>. In this place a new
                  period in my life commenced, and I learned to know, more than ever, that I must
                  lean on my <roleName>Savior</roleName>, and him only. It was clear to me that I
                  had a call to <placeName>Bayldon</placeName>, and that I was in my proper place
                  when teaching <name type="object">school</name>; our <roleName>Savior</roleName>

               <p> me and blessed my endeavors. I became more stripped of my self righteousness, and
                  learned to rely more fully on the merit and faithfulness of
                     <roleName>Jesus</roleName>, in all circumstances for which I can never thank
                  him sufficiently. Nevertheless I now and then got into a way of self , which
                  caused me no small anxiety: but my all merciful <roleName>Savior</roleName> has
                  helped me and been <name type="emotion">very gracious</name> to me, amid it all my
                  infirmities of soul and body. I have often been troubled with needless
                  perplexities when reflecting on old age, and how I should get a maintenance in
                  that case; for I was always <name type="emotion">afraid</name> of being
                  burdensome; which I have never been to anyone, not even when I had two children to
                  support by my own hand-labour. But in this respect also the Lord has been better
                  than my fears and put me to shame, by prospering my endeavors, so that I have more
                  abundance now in my 83rd year, than I have has at any time, since I became a
                  widow, which is 51 years: and I cannot but acknowledge it as a singular favor,
                  that I am able, tho' in much weakness, to teach children as well as ever in any
                  part of my life; so that my old age has been signally favored with respect both to
                  external and internals; for which I </p>

                  of her life she dictated to her Son a short time before her end. She was mind
                  beloved and respected by all who knew her both here and at Duck[enfield, and had
                  proved a blessing to many. Soon after her arrival at
                     <placeName>Bayldon</placeName>, she heard of an old lady, in one of whose
                  tenements we had our former meeting place, one of our Brethren occupying the
                  house; but being unfriendly and pre judiced against us. she gave us warning to
                  quit the premises, which proved the occasions of our building the present small
                     <name type="object">chapel</name> and <name type="object">schoolhouse</name>.
                  Our late sister verified this lady and by means of her conversations gained her
                  entire <name type="emotion">affection</name> and <name type="emotion"
                     >confidence</name>. The old lady became <name type="emotion">sensible</name> of
                  her lost condition, sought for grace a the commission of sins thro' the atoning
                  blood of Jesus, which she also found and departed this life in peace. She was
                  greatly interested in the prosperity of the Society at
                     <placeName>Bayldon</placeName>, and when her son and the preacher, who
                  occasionally attended there from. <placeName>Fulneck</placeName>, where ready to

                     >fruit</name> to choir labours, as for some years there had been no increase to
                  the Society, but rather a diminution in member, owing to the departure of several
                  of the first member; she animated them to do their part faithfully, saying the
                  Lord would not be wanting on his side, adding: "You will see (better) brighter
                  Days, after I am gone.". *Their expectation was strikingly verified. At the

                  saying to her on the Day of her Departure: "My Dear mother, I wish our

                  keep me back, let me go freely; it will be best for me now; I want to be gone and
                  to see my Dear ,<roleName>Savior</roleName>." At noon, her son wishing her to take
