                  Brief - Memoir of our late happily
                  departed <persName>Sister Esther Latrobe</persName> drawn
                  up by her <persName>Husband</persName> and <persName>Brother</persName> </p>
                  
                  <p>Our late dear <persName>Relative</persName> was born at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>
                  <date>June the 7th 1802</date>, and being the only daughter
                  among a family of six children, was <name type="emotion">peculiar
                  ly precious</name> to her parents and brothers, and tenderly
                  beloved by them.</p> 
                  
                  <p>This <name type="emotion">tender affection</name> and <name type="emotion">endearment</name>
                  was always returned by her with a <name type="emotion">warmth
                  of feeling</name>, which evinced to her family, her
                  <name type="emotion">deep attachment</name> towards them, and the <name type="emotion">gra-
                  titude</name> heart to them for their <name type="emotion">love</name>.</p> 
                  
                  <p>She was very early subject of <name type="health">sickness
                  and pain</name>. In her childhood by occasion of the
                  <name type="health">measles</name>, which struck into her chest, she was
                  brought to the brink of the grave and her fami
                  ly and medical attendants at that time had
                  lost all <name type="emotion">hope</name> of her life. It pleased the
                  <name>Lord</name>, however to manifest in her case, <name>His</name>
                  Power as the <persName>Preserver</persName> of man, and her life
               </p>

                  was redeemed from destruction. At this period
                  already, the grace of the <persName>Lord Jesus</persName> was producing
                  in her conduct the buddings of that <name type="emotion">patient
                  endurance of suffering</name>, which was afterward
                  exhibited in blossom and in fruit. Her <name type="emotion">meek
                  submission under pain</name> was a wonder to many,
                  and her physician frequently expressed his 
                  <name type="emotion">astonishment</name>, that a child of her tender
                  frame and years, would exhibit such lamb-
                  like patience, under the pain he knew
                  she was enduring. When she was just 
                  eleven years old, she experienced another 
                  severe trial from the hand of the <persName>Lord</persName>, by
                  the death of her dear <persName>Mother</persName>. In common
                  with the other member's of her father's
                  house, she felt this <name type="emotion">bereavement keenly</name>, and
                  often wept in after-life at the remem-
                  brance of her loss. Indeed the loss was in 
                  some respect <name type="emotion">peculiar</name> to her, as a daughter,
                  and the only one; -- yet the <persName>Lord</persName> <name type="emotion">graciously</name> made
                  it up to her, as she <name type="emotion">felt and feelingly 
                  acknowledged</name>, by the fond cares of those whom
                  he still left her, and by the kindness of many
                  kindness dear friends, not immediately
               </p>

                  belonging to her own family. 
               </p>
                  
                  <p>She spent the years of her schooling
                  partly in <placeName>Bristol</placeName> under the care of <persName>Sister Bird</persName>
                  and subsequently at <placeName>Tytherton</placeName>. The latter
                  place was <name type="emotion">very dear</name> to her; where she lived
                  a great and interesting part of her pilgrim--
                  age, and there she found rest to her soul in the 
                  atoning merit of her <persName>Saviour</persName>. </p>
                  
                  <p><persName>Brother</persName> and <persName>Sister West</persName> were as parents 
                  to her, and she became the intimate friend of 
                  their eldest daughter. This was an attach-
                  ment formed and maintained in the <persName>Lord</persName>, and
                  we have reason to believe that our dear
                  <persName>Relative</persName> often and frequently felt is to be for 
                  her good, a strengthening of her hands in
                  God. During these years, she was brought
                  again to the verge of eternity, by means of 
                  a rheumatic fever, and a violent affection or 
                  palpitation of the heart. Again did her medi-
                  cal attendants give her up and her <name type="emotion">sorrowing</name> 
                  friends <name type="emotion">despaired</name> of her life, but yet once more
                  was the <persName>Lord's</persName> hand stretched forth to save 
                  her, and she was restored to her family.</p>

                  They received her again as one raised from the
                  dead, and she consequently became still more
                  <name type="emotion">dear</name> and <name type="emotion">precious</name> to them all. These alarming 
                  sicknesses were evidently blessed to her soul,
                  they were means and times of grace to her.</p>
                  
                  <p>She was led to search and try her ways, and to 
                  seek the <persName>Lord</persName> with full purpose of heart 
                  and he was graciously found of her. Knowing
                  now the end of our dear relative, we can trace
                  clearly the good hand of our <persName>Lord</persName> in all these
                  dispensations; we can see how he purified
                  her, and made her fit for his service, and meet

                  which took place with her before the end of the

                  Undoubtedly not. He should lead the chorus.
                  Each breath should sound forth the praises
                  of so blessed and adorable a friend. May thy

                  and her <name type="emotion">interest</name> in the welfare of the Congre-

                  to the Saviour and his people which not only 
                  sweetens the cup of life, but is essential to 
                  the usefulness of the Lords servants. She

                  her conversation proved to be a blessing and a <name type="emotion">comfort</name>.
                  Although no longer engaged in the education
                  of children, yet that <name type="emotion">love</name> to the lambs of the

                  vate meditations, was undiminished. 
                  Remembering the blessings she had experienc-
                  ed when taken in early life, by her parents
                  to the children's meetings at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, and
                  also the impression, which the remarks and 
                  advice of her beloved father had made upon
                  her youthful mind, she felt a <name type="emotion">strong int-
                     trest</name> in behalf of the children of this
                  congregation, and impelled by that interest, 
                  she accompanied her husband to the house-
                  es of all the parents, previous to the children's 
                  Festival, although by no means well at the 
                  time. The weighty and affectionate words and 
                  expostulations she employed on that occasion 
                  as a consequence of that visit, was, the 
                  recommencement of meetings for the child-

                  some time discontinued. She was <name type="emotion">peculiar

                  of her husband, while he was engaged in visit-
                  ing the boy on his sickbed. Sabbaths were
                  days of special <name type="emotion">delight</name> to her; she <name type="emotion">loved</name> the 
                  assembly of the <persName>Lords</persName> people, whither public 
                  or private, often prolonging the subjects that 
                  had been treated of in private conversation,
                  and expressing her gratitude for the abundant 
                  provision of <persName>Gods</persName> house. Even when indispo-
                  sed in body, and gently urged to stay at home, 
                  she often said, in allusion to her approach-
                  ing confinement. No I will go to the <persName>Lord's</persName> house 
                  while I can you know I shall soon be deprived
                  of that privilege for a considerable time."
                  The event, which she thus alluded to, natural-
                  ly led her to frequent meditation and converse,
                  on the possibility of its terminating in her 
                  <name type="emotion">dissolution</name>, and some months ago, she expres-

                  see fit to make it the occasion of her change
                  coming, all would be well; she could meet

                  when walking with her husband in the peace-

                  fested towards her and her husband, both by our

                  was <name type="emotion">gratefully</name> felt by her. On this subject and 
                  on the general state of her mind, she thus

                  As the time of her confinement approached,
                  she stayed her mind <name type="emotion">calmly</name> on the <name>Lord</name>, neither
                  giving way to needless fears, nor yet elated with 
                  too sanguine hopes. She found the letter and 
                  advice of her dear father a great help to her,
                  truly <name type="emotion">valuing</name> the privilege of having relatives,
                  who were bound to her by the double ties of

                  especially the case on wednesday, when she
                  took occasion from the daily word: "The <persName>Lord</persName>
                  hath called me from the womb ? "to speak to
                  <persName>Sr Borland</persName>, to whom she was deservedly attach

                  first infancy, in caring for her, hedging up her

                  <name type="emotion">gently</name> by the streams of salvation, and in the 
                  green pastures of his love. She spoke also 
                  of the <name type="emotion">happiness</name> and profit she had derived,
                  from her connection with the <placeName>Bretherands Church</placeName>,
                  Indeed she sincerely <name type="emotion">loved</name> this part of the 
                  <persName>Lord's</persName> vineyard, as is plain from her manuscript
                  which contains meditations on some memorial
                  days of our church, and petitions on behalf of 
                  some of its members. She passed the friday 
                  very favourably, and though she did not sleep much
                  during the night, her medical attendant expres
                  sed this <name type="emotion">satisfaction</name> at her state on saturday
                  morning, and declared he did not expect to find her
                  so well. About the middle of the day, however,
                  <name type="health">unfavorable symptoms appeared</name>, which did
                  not yield to the remedies applied, and when her

                  yet still the <name type="health">symptoms increased</name>. She often reproved the
                  anxiety of those around her, and scarcely repressed her
                  tears, bidding them not to cast away their <name type="emotion">confi
                  dence</name>. After a lapse of two hours, still stronger
                  means were resorted to, as a final hope, and her
                  husband proposing that they should unite in
                  beseeching the blessing of the <name>Lord</name> for her
                  restoration, she expressed her <name type="emotion">desire</name> that this
                  should be alone; begging him at the same time
                  not to weep, for she was in the <name>Lord's</name> hands,
                  He had often raised her up for when brought low,
                  and could do it again if He pleased. All were
                  now <name type="emotion">composed</name> after prayer, and the dear sufferer
                  being asked if she were resigned to the <persName>Lord's</persName> will,
                  whatever it might be, replied <name type="emotion">cheerfully</name>, "Yes I am."
                  Shortly after, she added with <name type="emotion">great emphasis</name>:

                  Observing the tears of those about her, she

                  and proceeded to say: "I had once to seek my <persName>Saviour</persName>,
                  "when in this state, but not now. I know he 
                  "will do all things well!" During the night
                  some of the <name type="health">symptoms abated</name>, though the most
                  alarming continued. She became very heavy,
                  slept, and wandered occasionally in her mind, yes
                  always in an edifying way. Early in the morn
                  ing her medical attendant came, felt her
                  pulse, shook her head, and upon having her 
                  loom, informed her husband, that all hope of
                  her life was now gone, mortification had
                  commenced, and that day would be her last.

                  she had appeared almost insensible before, she
                  seemed to understand him in a moment, looked

                  and <name type="emotion">firmness</name> said: "Yes my dear I am! Having fun

                  a pause insued, a period of sobs and tears, "Don't cry for
                  me" she said, "I am happy going to our <persName>Saviour</persName>",
                  Turning to her husband, she said: "The <persName>Lord</persName> will sup-
                  port you and bless you, and be far more to you than I have
                  been. We have been <name type="emotion">very happy</name> together, but now you
                  "must give me up to the <persName>Lord</persName>. Don't weep." and then
                  she looked up with <name type="emotion">glory</name> in her countenance, and 
                  exclaimed; "O the delights, the heavenly joys,

                  and who would not go there" Every thing like
                  wandering or insensibility had now completely felt 
                  her. She seemed to realize, in the body, the joys
                  that were before her, and her bedside became the very
                  gate of heaven. It was as though the place were
                  surrounded by <name type="emotion">happy</name> spirits and holy angels, waiting
                  to receive her redeemed soul, when it should be uncloth-

                  took that opportunity to say to <persName>Sister Borland</persName>;" Ask <persName>Brother

                  said to <persName>Sister Borland</persName>, who was weeping "Don't cry before

                  was waiting to speak to her, she replied: "Oh! yes
                  send for her, let her come while I can speak." As soon
                  as she had come to the bedside, the <name type="health">dying patient</name> grasp
                  ed her hand and said: "O my dear, you must come out
                  of the world and leave its vanities and attend to the salva
                  tion of your soul. I know it is hard to leave the
                  world, but you must do it, if you would have hope in
                  your death, when you are like me." She said more
                  to the same purpose, and directed her to the <persName>Lord Jesus</persName>,
                  and when the young lady promised to be kind to her

                  blessed thing to die on the sabbath, and no enter into an eternal sabbath."---- Shortly after it was proposed to sing with her; she said: oh! you! do"---- and being asked to choose a
                  verse, she gave out: "O then the sole defence and aid and but owing to the indistinctness of her voice only a few words were gath- ered and being it could not be found at the hine.

                  composure, and often begged those around her not to weep for her, for she was happy. Once or twice she said, "perhaps the Doctor is mistaken. I am too strong to die, I do not feel as
                  if I were dying." But about two hours and a half before her departure she said placidly: "Now I feel a change, it will not be long now." and then she betook herself again to comfort
                  those around her, &amp; especially her sorrowing partner. To him she said, with tender affection: "the lord will support you &amp; supply all your wants, I know he will, for I have
                  prayed for you"--- He replies "yes my dear I know he will, but it is hard to part with you so soon."----"O! yes,"she answered, it is hard </p>

                  addressed him: "How "long shall I live Doctor? He seemed much affected, &amp; replied: "My dear Mrs. Lattrobe, I am sorry to say "you cannot be long." "Sorry! she said, sorry--- do
                  not say sorry. I am glad. Will it be two hours?" He answered that it could not be much longer, &amp; that he was happy to see her so resigned: when she explained: "Let me die the
                  death of the righ- teous, &amp; let my last end be like his! " here mom- ents were now spent in sacred prayer, &amp; in com- forting the survivors, but in a short time the struggle
                  of death became hard, though they were not severe, &amp; she said "it is a hard work to die"---&amp; several times, asked, "will it be long?" she was told it probably would not, but
                  that the Lord would give her strength equal to her day. This seemed to satisfy her, foron being asked, whether a prayer should be made for her release she said: "No! no! the Lords
                  time is best, I can wait patiently for that"--- 'Yes' said she- though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear </p>
