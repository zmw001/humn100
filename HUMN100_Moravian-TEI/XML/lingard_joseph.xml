                  the present Widdow, and had with her one son and

                  In <name type="event">the great Awakening</name> which happened here round
                  about in the <date>Year 1743</date>. our Brethren and his Wife became
                  <name type="emotion">concerned</name> to about their <name type="emotion">happiness</name>. <date>Ao 44</date> was he
                  <name type="event">first aquainted with the Brethren</name> and as the same year
                  our <persName>Brethren Okerthaussen</persName> was <name type="event">put in prison</name> for our <persName>Saviors</persName>.
                  Sake, he and some Brethren more had the <name type="emotion">Happiness</name>
                  to partake on his <name type="emotion">reproach of scorn</name> for the Gospel of 
                  Christ. The preachings were kept in his House; but
                  as his Son came of Age he became the Cause, that
                  it must be left. Our Brother was of very few words,
                  not talkative at all; however he <name type="emotion">loved</name> the Brethren
                  with whom he was assembled so well and dearly, that he
                  very seldom stayed at home, notwithstanding
                  he had above three Miles to walk; and in his <name type="health">last
                  sickness</name> he expressed himself still about? as little 
                  he sometimes understood, what he said or sung, for
                  all that he was a praying to our <persName>Savior</persName> that he would
                  let him partake on their blessing and this was richly
                  bestowed on him. He once met <persName>Brethren Bohler</persName> on the Road
                  to <placeName>Brassington</placeName>, and brought him the first time about 
                  this Place, whereover, he rejoiced still in this <name type="health">last
                  Days</name>. He visited the <orgName>Congregation in Fulneck</orgName> several
                  times and <name type="emotion">felt a call in his Heart</name> to seek his abode
                  in this <orgName>Congregation</orgName>. But this was not sooner
                  performed while he was persuaded by his son, to 
                  give over to him his whole estate, however as soon 
                  as he consented, the son pulled down his dwellinghome
                  that he was forced as it were to seek his shelter at <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>.

                  <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>. Whereover he shortly before his End, declared
                  himself towards his son. I lived above 80 years in this
                  world, and have done nothing better, as my going to
                  <placeName>Dukenfield</placeName>; and you never have done anymore good
                  for me: then to pull down my Dwellings. 
                  He came hither as a stranger, with his wife and daughter
                  with a stick in his hand, without knowing where to
                  find a place of his abode; but a brother took him to
                  long in his house, till we could provide a lodging
                  for him. He now was very <name type="emotion">glad</name> to find for himself under
                  the <orgName>People of God</orgName>. To be <name type="event">received into the Blessings of
                  the Congregation</name> he must stay very long, however <date>1759</date>.
                  he was with his wife and daughter received into the <orgName>Congregation</orgName>
                  and <date>1760</date> was <name type="event">admitted to our dear Lords Supper</name>. Which
                  he took for his highest treasure in this world. His bodily
                  Constitution was very strong, but since 2 years <name type="health">his strength
                  decreased very remarkable</name> and he begun to pine for
                  his eternal Rest. In his <name type="health">last sickness</name>, he was very 
                  certain that his Desire would be soon fulfilled. 
                  His Patience contented Contemplations has been every
                  Body who saw him to <name type="emotion">admiration</name>. Every Body 
                  liked to be with him and therefore rather thronged them
                  selves which Brother was to watch him. The <name type="emotion">Happyness</name>
                  of his Heart spread itself from it so that every Stranger
                  could perceive what our <persName>Saviour</persName> has done on this old
                  Vater. After he had blessed his Wife and Daughter and recommended
