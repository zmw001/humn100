               <p> I <persName>Sam.l Tippett</persName> have thought it might not be amiss to leave the following lines behind me I was Born in the year of our Lord in <date>1711</date> In the

                  <name type="event">My Father died</name> when I was young, my mother kept me to school tho with some difficulty, For I was of a light turn of mind and giving very much to play with
                  other Boys which made my mother pretty sharp with me, Tho at some times I should have sarious thoughts and think what will become of me when I die and should wish I had never been
                  born or died when I had been at my mothers breast, Then I thought I should went to Heaven, But who knows what will become of me now, I have been such a bad Boy, and told so many
                  lies, and said nasty words, and many of the like thoughts would come into my mind, Then I should think to be better and not do so nomore, and often wish I had one or two little Boys
                  of my mind to go to Church and to be good and to live a Religious life, and did often times wish I had liv'd in the days of our Saviour, and think how I wou'd have lov'd Him and
                  follow'd him had it been even to death, so that when I did Read of His death and sufferings. I should melt into tears, so that I was fors't to give over Reading, although it was the

                  a little Book as I met with by chance I felt
                  something in my Heart that I never felt before,
                  and had it been possible I cou'd then even <name type="emotion">sunk
                  into nothing in tears of love</name> before the Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>
                  and the Covenant that I made with Him that
                  evening I though then to have kept to all the days
                  of my Life, But this soon wear'd of, and for want
                  of care taken as I grew biger my corruped
                  nature grew stronger and stronger and led me more
                  and more captive, at Ten years of age or these
                  about I <name type="event">went to work in the Coal Pitt</name>
                  amongs't other other bad Boys, though my Mother
                  porswade my to go a Prentis but I cou'd
                  not bear the though of loosing my
                  companion, and be confind, But as I grew
                  in years older and older at last I thought
                  to make my self happy in what the
                  world called merry company, But twas
                  all in vain, for I was <name type = "emotion">disapointed</name> in
                  every thing that I did take in hand,
                  So that often times in the midts of
                  mirth I should have such <name type="emotion">heapiness
                  of spirit</name> come upon me that I did
                  not know what to do, some times I did
                  endeavour to pass it away by singing
                  or Dancing or such like, and some times
                  leave my company, and think if I was with

               <p> with other company then perhaps i should be better satisfied, but this would not do for twas all in vain, for when i was coming home my heart would begin to smite me. thinking where
                  have i been and what will become of me if i go on at this rate, then i should make many resolutions not to do no more of beg of lord to forgive me, but in a few days all my
                  resolutions would be broken and i should think it is fine enough if for me to turn may live a great while, i am but young if as my father died in of consumption to may i an then it
                  will be time enough to represent if turn to the lord but this would not satisfy my poor mind long together, for when my thoughts of dying suddenly or being killed in if did come in
                  mind i did not know what to do, but should beg of lord to spare me a little longer, for i could not bear thoughts of leaving world in of condition i was then in, this i went on for
                  many years together sinning if responding striving to get happiness in my pleasures of this life is positive but i was all in vain, for i was disappointed in all my </p>

               <p> ways that I did think to get happiness in, abought this time I goot aguainted with my dear wife and was maried into the year <date>1736</date> by whome I have had Eleven Children,
                  For the first two years and more I went on in my old cource of life with my merry Company thinking by &amp; by it will be better, but I new not how for I was disapointed in every
                  thing and all that I took in hand seem'd to make against me; that I knew not which way I shou'd come through in the world about this time Mr. <persName>Whitfield</persName> came in
                  these parts and I went to hear him at a place cal'd <placeName>Hannam Mount</placeName>, He spoke of the Prodigal son returning to his Father and of our fall by nature and how
                  willing Jesus Christ was to receive every returning sinner, He painted my case and condition as tho he new me from the very bottom, and envited all such poor sinners to Jesus Christ
                  in a loving manner, I thought this was to good news to be believ'd that ever he cou'd receive or look upon such a poor reck as I was who had been fighting against him </p>

               <p> all the days of my life, But this seem'd as a Hook in my Heart for some days, Tho I was asham'd to let any one know anything about it, But I thought if this be true there is nothing
                  in all the world shall hinder me till I know he have receiv'd me, if he will except of the such a poor sinner as I am, soon after this hear'd Mr Sennick under the secumore Tree near
                  Mr Wesleys scool it being the first or second time of his preaching, But I had not been there many minutes but my heart was all most ready to break, He spoke from the first chapter
                  of Saint John and something of his own experience which came near my heart thinking to my self what shall I do to be sav'd, my sins as if weare steard me in the face, my companians
                  and all I thought wou'd be witness against me at the Last Day, and as I had not been the ruination of my own poor soul but theirs also, and now I was a mark for every one to laugh
                  at, and many more of the like expression was the languige of my poor heart for the whole sermon I stood in amaze asham'd to look anyone in the face thinking no ones condition like
                  mine in the whole world, but yet thought how glad I shou'd be if I cou'd but get aquainted with that man and look'd after him till he was gone out of my sight, But in less then a

                  went to <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and I inquired where he lied and
                  got him over to <placeName>Kingswood</placeName> with us that night,
                  He slept at my House and I never thought my
                  self so <name type="emotion">happy</name> in all my former compoany as I did
                  when I was along with him, if often
                  did on bosom my mind into him as my only
                  friend, but about this time I heard <persName>Mr Wesloy</persName>
                  preach up a self denial life, how we should live
                  and walk which put me to work I caused me
                  many akin heart after word, so that I did
                  often times with I could never eat drink nor
                  sleep no more until I did know the Lord <persName>Jesus</persName> did
                  love me I had forgiven me my sins, then
                  I was confirmed went to the sacrament
                  thinking to find ease there, but I found it
                  quite to the contrary, for this added to my
                  trouble that I was more condonned than ever
                  thinking no ones condition like mine
                  in the whole world,tossed  to and forget
                  rest for my poor heart but could find
                  none, and was often times making of
                  resolutions to get into the woods, or to some
                  retired place where I might spend the
                  rest of my days and never eat nor drink
                  no more till I did know that <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> did love
                  me, but in this I was also <name type="emotion">disappointed</name> for go
                  where I would if uneasiness of my heart and the

                  condition that I did not know what to do with myself.
                  The some times in midst of all although
                  would dash into my mind, who knows but I shall
                  be said at last, perhaps if Lord do love me
                  he have promised to save such ones as in my
                  condition therefore I will never rest free
                  I know that he have said me, about this time
                  I and four more was taken into a band by <persName>Mr Sennick</persName> at <persName>Mr Wesloy</persName>, scool where we
                  met constant together every week for some
                  time I not without a lifeliving, about this time
                  I was very near like to be killed two or three times
                  in the pitt and by some other accident, if one of the
                  times my hurt was pretty bad not I thought

                  I was then in though of if same time I did
                  not know that any one had any thing to
                  righteous life, I fasted two or three times
                  every week, I prayed perhaps ten or twenty times
                  every day as after as I had opportunity, I went
                  to my sacrament every month, Every hour
                  that I did steps I did think twas time lost,
                  and did often times wish I could never sleep
                  no more, my countenance did betray my poor
                  miserable heart, some times with heats a sigh
                  would bust from my heart O that I did but
                  know if Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>, or was afraid of his love

               <p> to my poor heart, though sometimes between while a thought would dart into my mind who knows but I shall be saved at last perhaps jesus do love me. if one promise after another
                  would come into my mind that my very heart would leap for day but soon after i should give all over and think it was something of my own making and getting into my old course of
                  duties as before, till at last i was a weary of my left righteous life, for if more i did strive of faster i was so that i did not love to hear so much of simple doings for i found
                  it was all nothing but stuff and with a full determination thought if i porrith i will porrith at of feel of jesus as a poor sinner, for i was a sensible that nothing could satisfy
                  my poor heart but Him, and about this time as I was in a coal pitt making my complaint to if Lord Jesus as I use to do had i but a minute time, but all of a sudden it was as though
                  he spoke to me i am could if do love thee but what if i felt in my heart that moment words who felt in my hear that moment words all my uneasiness of heart was gone in a moment, and
                  Him whom i looked upon before as being angry with me i found was my best friend in the whole world that it been possible i could then. </p>

                  and down with me for some time until the wickedness
                  of my Heart began to appear, which made me think
                  I had decieved myself, though at times I did feel
                  to the contract I could not give it up, about this
                  as perfection reprobation and and if like which put
                  me to reasoning often times made me uneasy
                  in my mind whom I did enter upon them, we
                  had several meetings to try to reconcile it
                  but to no purpose, for in a little time <persName>Brother
                     Sennick</persName> and twenty four more of us was put out
                  along with him out of the society, we went to
                  look a little room where we did meet together
                  every evening and had a pretty feeling amongst
                  us, until at last our number increased so fast
                  that the place we had taken was to little to hold
                  us so that when we had a love feast for
                  want the room we was forced to keep it in
                  the open fields and the spirit of love was felt
                  amongst us, so that many of those that
                  did stand of at distance at the outside
                  of hedges that did not belong to us did
                  not go away without a blessing, but as
                  winter was coming on <persName>Brother Sennick</persName> was 
                  resould to build a school house, bought a piece
                  of ground and had it covered before winter

               <p> against it, there is together in love and our saviour was other times feeling in my mind we was soon form'd into classes or bands by who we look'd upon as our chief labourer that
                  went in and out before you, my heart felt well at that time so that i could keep band with our saviour as though there was but he and i in of whole world, but some time after this
                  brethren cennik plan began to get wider in Willtshear of many other places, so that he could not be so much at kingswood as before so that many others was in place when he was
                  absent, the enemy seeing that we was like to come to something soon found out away to put a stop to our happiness by something up dochins of many other truths an of place of Jesus
                  Christ this offer times make me heavy if conserved when i began to see what confusion was creeping in amongst us, but in ye year i went to london with br connick there i heard
                  brother gomball, rogers, hutton, it was in some of brother company several times while i stayed there which often times made me wish to see your spirit of love and hearing of
                  kingswood as i say was amongst them, but after i came home instead of seeing it better it grew worse </p>

               <p> if worse, so that our number which was in the society of about 80 or so was soon reduced to 50 or so, this caused me pain, and made me make my complain to our savior as though there
                  was but he and I in the whole world, out reaching was all dropped and I knew not what if end of it would be, then I with the consent of 2 or 3 more wrote to Brother and begged that
                  they would come and labour among'st us, and their answer was get they did not see their call quite clear from our savior but so soon as they did they would gladly run to our
                  assistance, four or five brother of us met together every sunday morning making our complaint- one to another and our dear saviour was often times near our hearts, and sunday
                  afternoon our little society of about 20 or 30 did meet together and thus we went on together for sometime, being look'd upon as a stubborn people that a mark for every one to laugh
                  at as for my own part i meet with many trials on every ride, my nearest kindred was set against me and those that before was my bosom friends forsook me and look'd upon me with

                  times comforted my Poor Heart I could not have come through in these troublesome times, I continu'd writing to the Brethren as often as Opportunity arriv'd because it was so in my

                  &amp; tould him the many disputes that had been a-
                  mongst us, And our Saviour blessed our conversation
                  that it was as though a Burden had been
                  taken from me, or as a prisoner set
                  free Especially when he told me as I
                  might look upon my self as under their
                  care &amp; that our saviour had made it out
                  that they should come once a month &amp;

                  <persName>Cennciks</persName> right to the school because

                  by violence without Brother <persName>Cennicks</persName> knowing
                  any thing about it, Then after that was

                  with home I am determined to spend the

                  that I can unburden my mind to as I can write him, for the older i get the more trouble I meet with, so that I have more need of him now then ever and do often times wish that I
                  could lose myself in his company &amp; never dispart from him no more, For when i feel his sweet nearness I want nothing else but to be lost in Him and the outward circumstances
                  &amp; family affairs have taken up to much of my time &amp; caused me pain, yet my best friend is faithfull unto me, &amp; in his due time will put all these things to right, In the
