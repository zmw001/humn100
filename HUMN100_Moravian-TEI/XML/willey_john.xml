                  <persName>John Willey</persName>, a Servant of the
                  <roleName>Lord</roleName> in the Brn's Church, who departed
                  this lifse in <placeName>Gracehill</placeName>, <date>October
                     6th 1847</date>. Aged 66 years. Written by his children Not
                  having been able to find any account of our dear father's
                  life, written by himself, we can merely record some of the
                  principal outward outward changes which he met with here,
                  adding, the few remarks on himself and his experience, which
                  have recurred to us in the <name type="object">private
                     diaries</name> of his congregation and in his
                  cor(r)espondence. He was born <date>Dec. 13th 1781</date> in
                  <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>; his father,
                  <persName>Michael Willey</persName> (born <date>1729</date>
                  died aged 86, having served the the Congregation 66 years" was
                  at that time laborer of the Congregation at
                  <placeName>Pudsey</placeName>. He had one sister being and
                  one brother, <persName>Joseph</persName>, both older
                  ​​​​​​​than </p>

               <p> than himself; of whom his brother was many years an active
                  minister of several congregations, and was called home before
                  him to his eternal rest, <date>Aug. 11th 1841</date>. A strong
                  <name type="emotion">affection</name> existed between the
                  brothers, and some of our dear father's <name type="emotion"
                     >happiest</name> seasons were the visits which he was
                  occasionally though rarely able to pay to his brother and
                  family. His early life, though chequered by the <name
                     type="health">death</name> of an affectionate mother, when
                  he was only 6 years of age, appears to have passed very
                  pleasantly among the youth in <placeName>Fulnec</placeName>.
                  His old teacher <persName>B. Bradley</persName>, kept an
                  unfailing place in his memory, and he spoke much and with
                  great kindness of his well-remembered <name type="emotion"
                     >care</name> and <name type="emotion">love</name>. As a
                  sign of the comparative innocences of those early years, he
                  would mention the fact that he had never heard an oath
                  ​​​​​​​until he had attained the age of 12 years </p>
            </div>

               <p> years. From some narratives of that time which he would
                  occasionally call to mind, it seems as tho' his habitual <name
                     type="emotion">good temper</name> had early displayed
                  itself, and rendered him a favorite amongst his teachers and
                  companions. At the age of 14, he went, as was there customary,
                  to learn a trade in <placeName>Bedford</placeName>, where he
                  experienced great kindness from <persName>Br.
                     Livius</persName>, of whom he long retained a grateful
                  recollection. Here of course, he was somewhat more of the
                  world and of its ways of sinful pleasure, and appears to have
                  <name type="emotion">lamented</name> the want of Godliness
                  amongst many of the young people with whom he was associated.
                  It was particularly whilst on a visit in
                  <placeName>London</placeName>, on his way to
                  <placeName>Kingswood</placeName> that he was struck with
                  the deep depravity of human nature, and found <name
                     type="emotion">gratitude</name> to that
                  <roleName>Lord</roleName>, to whom he had been early led,
                  and who had so mercifully held his preserving hand </p>

               <p> hand over him. At the same time, we doubt not, he obtained
                  deeper views of his own sinfulness, and of his need of the
                  salvation wrought for sinners, though the meritorious life and
                  death of our <roleName>Lord and Savior</roleName>
                  <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>. In <date>1802</date>, when
                  21 years of age, he went to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>;
                  and on his father's being appointed laborer of
                  <placeName>Kingwood congregation</placeName> about that
                  time, he was frequently with him there assisting in the school
                  in that place. It was here he was viewed with the
                  Congregation, and shortly after, in <date>1804</date>, very
                  permitted to partake for the first time of the <name
                     type="event">Holy Communion</name> There events seem to
                  have made a way deep impression upon his mind, if we may judge
                  from a remarkable experience which he has recorded as having
                  happened in him on the morning of <name type="event">Palm
                     sunday</name>
                  <date>1804</date>. If it came upon me sleeping, he </p>

               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-05">5 </head>
               <p> he writes, it made the same impression as though I had been
                  awake. There came over me a great <name type="emotion"
                     >fear</name> and trem- bling violent sweat, and a <name
                        type="emotion">dread</name> of being destroyed instantly. I
                  lifted up my hand and raised my eyes, but could not rise, for
                  the clothes were as a rock around me. There stood one whose
                  eyes were fixed on me, with a shining light; before him an
                  upright pillar, with which I expected to be slain, for the
                  sense of my <name type="emotion">guilt</name> increased my
                  <name type="emotion">fear</name>. I never can forget his
                  look. He spoke - O how long have I delayed my coming; how long
                  have I observed thy ways; I have had patience with thee; thou
                  hast had advantages but thou hast neglected them; thy crimes
                  are very great, thou hast been preserved through <name
                     type="emotion">mercy</name> hither to, but now ______ Here
                  I prayed <name type="emotion">earnestly</name> for mercy, that
                  I might not Be destroyed in my sins; yet my heart was hard as
                  the rock. I was powerfully convinced that it was
                  <persName>Jesus</persName> who ​​​​​​​stood before me, and
                  continued praying till </p>

            <div type="page" n="6">
               <head type="page" ana="MemLon_300050-06">6 </head>
               <p> Till at last he mercifully Caused floods of tears to flow
                  from mine eyes. Where I still in treated him to have mercy on
                  me a wretched and <name type="emotion">guilty</name> sinner,
                  his countenance changed, he seemed filled with <name
                     type="emotion">compassion</name>, looked on me with pity,
                  and spoke to me kindly, so that I was convinced I was heard.
                  His last words were very impressive. "Be in earnest for your
                  soul's salvation lest I come quickly with a woe." Where he
                  vanished, the pillar that that seemed ready to destroy me,
                  appeared changed into a hom(e) of salvation. I awoke to my
                  utter astonishment, and continued long in prayer for the
                  assistance I have daily and hourly need from a crucified
                  <roleName>Savior</roleName>. Our dear father appears about
                  this time to have been tried with a <name type="health"
                     >delicate state of health</name>, sometimes <name
                        type="health">suffering from new and affections</name>,
                  which had their bad effects upon his spirits. In <date>May

                  school there, but was soon again (<date>Sept 1808</date>)
                  recalled to <placeName>Mirfield</placeName>. The 5 years spent
                  in the school there, he remembered with much <name

                  few of his old schools have shown that theyt recall his memory
                  with <name type="emotion">pleasure</name>. He spoke after of
                  his agreeable and brotherly intercourse with <persName>Br.
                     Pohlman</persName>, there Minister and Director of the
                  school at <placeName>Mirfield</placeName>. His spare time was
                  spent in visiting the sick in the neighborhood, and in
                  cultivating that science which always retained such <name
                     type="emotion">attractions</name> for him, and in which he
                  certainly displayed mean talent. The corespondence afterwards
                  maintained with his relative, <persName>Sir W.
                     Hamilton</persName> on astronomical subjects, was a source
                  of great delight to him; and the laborious and neatly expected

               <p> His ingenuity and talent. It was in Mirfield in March 1809, that he first publicly proclaimed the Gospel,to be- come a faithful minister of which, we sincerely believe, was his
                  highest aim. In Sept. 1812 he was called to be Sgle. Brn’s Laborer in Fulnec ;a part which he found more difficult than the one he had occupied in Mirfield. He lament ed the
                  wait(weight) of the spiritual life in ma- ny members of the choir for the good of which he was appointed to labor; and cases might occur here, as elsewhere, where his meek and
                  yielding temper would make the exercise of proper disci- pline, and faithfulness in reproving, a difficult task for him. In June 1814 he was called to Dublin, As Sgle Brn’s Laborer,
                  and remained in that past for 3 years, during which time we know of little worth recording concerning him. In 1817 he was ordained in Grace- Hill by Br. Benade, and called to serve
                  the Congn. at Ballinderry. August 21 he was married to the Sgle .Sr.Susan Hutton, </p>

               <p> that teacher in the ladies school at Gracehill. In Ballinderry they spent 10 useful and happy years; but also their four oldest surviving children were born; one little daughter
                  being taken from them by the Lord in early infancy. In 1826 they removed to Cootehill, a congregation which had been for some years without a Laborer, and was in a very low
                  condition, seeming to require all the energy which health and activity could supply. Here, as long as his health permitted him, our dear father labored cheerfully and in blessing. An
                  account which he draw up for him- self of the various preaching places he attended in the neighborhood, and the success he met with in proclaim- ing the joyful news of saluation,
                  tes- tifies to his activity. In the year 1833, 1 year after his arrival in Cootehill, he visited 12 out-preaching places, mostly once a fortnight, at an average distance of 4 or 5
                  miles, and some 12 and even 17 miles from Cootehill. </p>

               <p> The following memorandum at the close of 1832,will share the spirit in which he labored:”When at the close of this year, I take a view of my poor, imperfect services in the vineyard
                  of our Lord, I see much cause for the deepest humiliation, on account of my innurmerable transgressions,failings, and short-comings, and fervently pray my merciful Saviour and
                  gracious Lord and Master, to forgive me in all things where in I have been to blame; whether it be in the omission of my duty, or in the performance of it in a wrong spirit, by
                  hearkening at times to the secret whisper of approbation in my unhallowed breast, and forgetting to give all the honor and glory to the Lord. It is by his gracious assistance, I have
                  been enabled to testify to my fellow-sinners, the richness of his Grace; whereas, if he had left me to myself, I should have sunk into shame and confusion .O that self </p>

               <p> and pride might be so mortified in me, that I might even remember, that I am naught but a poor, worthless, unprofitable servant, and Christ my All! Lord keep me contrite, low and
                  poor, Thus shall I praise thee memorie(his memory); Myself thrice blessed I can call, When I am nought, and thou my all!” In Cootehill,our dear Father’s health quickly declined, and
                  symp- tons of those complicated diseases began to show themselves, which gradually affected almost every vi- tal part, and mostly disabled him from duty during the last six years of
                  his life. Soon after his first serious attack, we find his experience recorded thus:”In the beginning of May 1841, I had a violent attack of influenza which lasted a long while, and
                  caused me to notice to rest early in the after- noon. In the month of July I left Cootehill for Ballinderry in hopes that the change of air might be of </p>

               <p> service to me ; but this not being the case, I begged my dismissal from ac- tive Service in Cootehill, for I saw my- self necessitated to notice from the work and labor of love in
                  which my soul delighted, by the severe Affliction by with which a merciful and long-suf- ferring Saviour visited me. I humbly, bow down with submission to his bles- sed will, and can
                  say in this trial. As I was enabled to do when lately receiving the account of my dear Bro- ther's departure: “It is the lord, let him Do what seemeth him good.” I feel too weak to
                  participate deeply of the cup of affiliation, and my dear Saviour favors me, by permitting me to leave all my griefs with him, and he con- fonts me in such a manner that I can not
                  say I have had an hours real dis- tress. After nearly 15 years labor amongst the little flock at Cootehill, having long shared both joy and grief with them, It is no wonder that I
                  feel much at the thoughts of being obliged to resign </p>

               <p> my change of them. My prayers at least on their behalf, shall be continued at the throne of grace. In looking at the fu- ture, it is still my desire, that if our Dear Lord and
                  Master should be pleased to bless the means used for my recovery, I may yet be employed in some part or other of his vineyard, to bear still further testimony of his great love to
                  sinners. O might I be more devoted to Him and serve Him more faithfully till the end of my days.” In the course of some months, our father thought himself sufficiently recovered to
                  asume his labors in Cootehill, and accordingly removed thither from Bal- linderry in March 1843. The Brn. &amp; Srs. rejoiced exceedingly on his return, wel- coming him with the
                  sincerest to- kens of affection; and the ensuing pas- sion season proved a time of great en- joyment to this little flock and to their pastor. But in the autumn of the same year he
                  felt his strength again failing, and in the winter he was frequently </p>

               <p> unable to preach. In the summer of 1844, he felt in(it) ne- cessary again to leave Cootehill, to which he never returned, but took up his resi- dence with his children at Glenary,
                  till the following year 1845. In April he returned to Gracehill, with the expecta- tion of ending his days in the midst of that Congregation. In the summer of 1846, according to the
                  Doctor’s advice, he sought change of air, and spent upwards of 4 months and lodgings near Bally- Castle, close to the sea-shore, which he believed through the Lord’s blessing, helped
                  to prolong his life. In the beginning of October he re- turned to Gracehill, and in the follow- ing winter endured much pain and severe suffering, with patience and resignation. To

               <p> around him were during these three years of trial, seasons of great plea- sure to him, and we have at such times been frequently struck with his cheerfulness and time enjoyment of
                  life amidst all its drawbacks, and edified with the example of resigna- tion and Christian patience which he presented to us. He did not converse much on subjects of spiritual
                  experi- ence, but his own interest in the truths of revelation, and particularly his love for and delight in our hymns was always apparent. When the spring of 1847 returned with- out
                  any lasting improvement in his state, he could express himself as per- fectly resigned to the Lord’s will with him, though he naturally longed for ease and outward comfort, and
                  faith- fully used every means recommend- ed. His faith meanwhile seemed purified in the fire of these afflic- tions, and his love and gratitude to the Saviour, were more ardent </p>

                  bless the <roleName>Lord</roleName> for his meeting me in the
                  way he has done, since nothing else would have brot me so
                  closely to his feet. I have learnt more of the <name
